### 3.2 Deprovisioned Users Still in Groups

**Risk Level: HIGH**

The following deprovisioned users remain as members of active groups. This should be cleaned up to maintain accurate group membership records:

## 5. Security Findings & Recommendations

### 5.1 Critical Issues

### 5.3 Recommendations

| # | Finding | Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---------|------|----------------|
| 6 | **Empty groups exist** | LOW | Review and remove unused groups (Customer Success, Product Management, Force of Knowledge) or populate with members |
| 7 | **Inconsistent domain usage** | LOW | Standardize on a single email domain across users |
| 8 | **MFA enrollment** | MEDIUM | Verify all active users have MFA enrolled; enforce MFA policy |
| 9 | **No privileged access group** | MEDIUM | Create dedicated groups for privileged access with appropriate application assignments |
